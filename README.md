Simple app to fix selected regions in an image based on the parameters set in the app. After the parameters are choosen, the app will iterate the parameters over all supported images (currently only jpg and png) in the folder of the current image. The app actually intended to fix reflective or glossy areas.

This app use ttk tkinter theme from this repository https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme

I am new to github, apologies...
