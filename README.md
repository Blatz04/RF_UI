Simple app to fix reflective regions in an image, default parameters is good enough I think but you can change the parameters by typing desired parameters in the app. You first pick the folder containing all the image or just paste folder path or the path of the image.
The app will iterate over all supported images (currently only jpg and png) in the folder.

This app use ttk tkinter theme from this repository https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme

and

rembg to remove the background, https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg
